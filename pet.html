        <h2>My Favorite Animal</h2>
        <img src="images/pet.jpg" alt="Favorite Pet">
        <p>My favorite animal is the <strong>dog</strong>, and there are so many reasons why they are the best companions one can have. Dogs are known for their loyalty, intelligence, and unconditional love. They come in a wide variety of breeds, each with unique traits and personalities. Whether big or small, fluffy or sleek, dogs are truly man's best friend.</p>
        
        <p>Dogs are not only great companions, but they also serve various important roles in society. Some are trained as service dogs, helping people with disabilities, while others work as therapy dogs, providing emotional support. There are also working dogs like police dogs, search and rescue dogs, and herding dogs who help with livestock. But no matter their job, every dog has a special place in our hearts.</p>
        
        <p>What makes dogs so special to me is their loyalty and the bond they share with their owners. Whether you’ve had a rough day or a great one, your dog will always be there to greet you with excitement and love. They are a reminder of the simple joys in life — a walk in the park, a game of fetch, or just curling up next to you on the couch.</p>
