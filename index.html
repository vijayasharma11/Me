        <h2>Introduce About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Your Picture" width="200px hight = 200px">
        

    
    <p>I am a <strong>Bachelor's graduate in Computer Engineering</strong> with a <strong>post-graduate diploma in Computer Engineering</strong> from C-DAC. I also hold a <strong>Diploma in Computer Engineering</strong>. Although I took a career break to focus on raising my children, I am now eager to resume my professional career and bring my experience back into the tech industry.</p>
    
    <p>I have accumulated <strong>3.8 years of professional experience</strong> as a Java/J2EE developer, with my most recent role being at <strong>3i Infotech</strong> in Mumbai (until October 2012). During my tenure, I worked on a variety of projects in the <strong>Retail Banking domain</strong>, utilizing technologies such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Java / J2EE (Servlets, JSP)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript, HTML, CSS</strong></li>
        <li><strong>SQL, Oracle, JDBC</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Ant</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These technologies allowed me to contribute effectively to web applications, database management, and backend development.</p>
    <p>In addition to my technical expertise, I am highly motivated to re-enter the workforce, learn the latest technologies, and contribute to projects in the Java/J2EE domain. I am confident that my experience and dedication will allow me to bring valuable contributions to your team.</p>
    <h3>Personal Background:</h3>
    <p>On a personal note, I am a mother of two young daughters. My husband is a Senior Vice President of Cyber Security at JP Morgan, and my children are currently in Primary School (P7 and P1). In my free time, I enjoy <strong>singing</strong> and <strong>traveling</strong>. These hobbies allow me to stay creative and maintain a healthy work-life balance.</p>
    <p>I am looking forward to the opportunity to update myself on the latest trends in Java and software development and to contribute to an organization that values continuous learning and growth.</p>
    <p>Best regards,<br>
